## ‚ú® Features

* **Intelligent Q&A:** Answers medical queries using a Large Language Model (LLM) powered by retrieved context.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhances LLM responses by fetching relevant information from a custom knowledge base.
* **Custom Knowledge Base:** Indexes and stores medical data from PDF documents.
* **Vector Database:** Utilizes Pinecone for efficient storage and semantic search of high-dimensional text embeddings.
* **HuggingFace Embeddings:** Employs `sentence-transformers` models (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for generating robust text embeddings.
* **LangChain Integration:** Orchestrates the RAG pipeline, connecting LLM, embeddings, and vector store components.
* **Flexible LLM Backend:** Configured to use **Google Gemma 3n 2B (free)** via the **OpenRouter.ai API gateway**.
* **Web Interface:** User-friendly chat interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS.

### Knowledge Base Source

The chatbot's medical knowledge base is derived from **The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine, 3rd Edition**. The PDF version of this encyclopedia was used to extract information, which was then processed and indexed into the Pinecone vector database.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your Medical Chatbot up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Anugrah0619/Medical_Chatbot.git](https://github.com/Anugrah0619/Medical_Chatbot.git)
cd Medical_Chatbot
```

---

## 2. Create and Activate Conda Environment

It's highly recommended to use a Conda virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n medbot python=3.10 -y
conda activate medbot
```

---

## 3. Install Required Libraries

Install all necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project (`Medical_Chatbot/`). This file will securely store your API keys.

Add your API keys to the `.env` file like this:

```env
PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key_here"
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"
```

> üîí **Do not share your `.env` file publicly.**

---

## 5. Prepare Medical Data (PDFs)

Place your medical PDF documents in a folder named `data/` inside the root directory:

```
Medical_Chatbot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example1.pdf
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example2.pdf
```

---

## 6. Initialize and Populate Pinecone Index

This step processes your PDF data, generates embeddings, and uploads them to your Pinecone vector database. Run this once to set up your knowledge base.

```bash
python store_index.py
```

This script will:
- Initialize the Pinecone client
- Create the `medicalbot` index if it doesn‚Äôt exist (`dimension=384`, `metric=cosine`)
- Chunk and embed PDFs using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Upload embeddings to Pinecone

---

## 7. Run the Flask Web Application

Once the Pinecone index is populated, you can launch the chatbot:

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## 8. Access the Chatbot

After starting the Flask app, open your browser and visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

You‚Äôll see the chatbot interface where you can ask questions related to the uploaded medical PDFs.

## ‚ú® Key Functionality in Action

The chatbot leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to deliver accurate responses. When a user asks a question, the system:
1.  Retrieves relevant information from its indexed knowledge base (The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine, 3rd Edition).
2.  Feeds this context along with the user's query to a **Google Gemma 3n 2B LLM (via OpenRouter.ai)**.
3.  Generates a concise answer, formatted with clear sections for **Description**, **Prevention**, and **Medications**, as instructed by the system prompt.

## üñ•Ô∏è Chatbot Interface

The chatbot features a clean, user-friendly web interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS. The design incorporates vibrant colors for user and AI messages against a sleek black background.

## üí¨ Sample Interaction (Visual)

## üé® Customize the User Interface

The chatbot's user interface is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can easily customize its appearance and layout:

* **HTML Structure:** Modify `templates/index.html` to change the layout of the chat elements.
* **CSS Styling:** Edit `static/style.css` to adjust colors, fonts, spacing, and animations. Feel free to experiment with new color schemes, gradients, and visual effects to match your preferences!
